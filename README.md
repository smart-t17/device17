## Device17

### Prerequisites

```
python3 (3.7.5)
pyenv
pipenv
PostgreSQL 11.5
```


## Use Python 3.7.5

```
brew install pyenv
brew install pipenv
pyenv install 3.7.5
pyenv shell 3.7.5
```

## Installing Postgresql

As of this Readme the latest stable version of Postgres is 11.5. Therefore running the following `brew` command should suffice.
However, it is always a good idea to check this website to make sure that the latest is in fact 11.5. If there is a newer version available you may need to add a suffix like so- `postgresql@11`.

https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/postgresql

```
brew install postgresql
```

Then install the dependicies (make sure postgresql is installed before):

```
cd device17
pipenv install --dev
```

If you get an error regarding zlib, following instructions here: https://github.com/jiansoung/issues-list/issues/13

Add the following lines to always be in python 3.7.5 to your .bash_profile and .bashrc file

```
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
pyenv shell 3.7.5
```

## Developing on the backend

### Database connection:

create a device17 database:
don't have postgresql installed? Refer to the section above titled "Installing Postgresql"

```
brew services start postgresql
psql -d template1
create database device17;
\c device17 ;


```

Also create a test database:

```
create database device17_test;
\c device17_test ;
```

If you see an `address already in use error` when trying to run `brew services start postgresql`, try

```
brew services list
brew services stop (OLD POSTGRES)
```

Run migrations:

```
FLASK_ENV=development pipenv run flask db upgrade
```

### Start local server

```
cd device17
FLASK_ENV=development pipenv run flask run
```

- go to: http://localhost:5000/

If you're using pyenv, you might need to specify the path to the python executable
installed through pyenv. You can get the path by doing:

```
pyenv which python
```

You can also add `FLASK_ENV` to your environment variables by adding

```
export FLASK_ENV=development
```

to your `.bash_rc` or `.zshrc`.

Don't have selenium?

```
brew cask install chromedriver
```

### Add dependencies

```
pipenv install <pip-package>
```

### Schema migrations

Update the model, then run

```
FLASK_ENV=development pipenv run flask db migrate -m 'YOUR COMMENT HERE'
```

to generate the alembic migration. _Make sure to glance at the auto-generated migration
file to double check that it's not unexpectedly going to drop anything._ Computers
aren't perfect! If you're connected to a local database, run

```
FLASK_ENV=development pipenv run flask db upgrade
```

to apply the migrations.

**Note**: `FLASK_ENV=development` tells flask to run using local config. If you're developing against the staging
database, running the `upgrade` command locally without rolling it back will likely cause
the migration to fail during deploy.

If you're developing against the production database, maybe just...don't.

## Developing on the client side

Please refer to `./client/README.md`.

### RabbitMQ:

RabbitMQ is a message-broker software that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)
to install it:

```
brew install rabbitmq
brew services start rabbitmq
```

the go to the default local url:

```
http://localhost:15672/#/
```

type in guest, guest

### Celery:

Celery is an asynchronous task queu.
We use it, for example, to connect with different loan providers. It should be installed with regular python dependencies

On local, open a new terminal and run:

```
FLASK_ENV=development pipenv run celery worker -A tasks --loglevel=info
```

### Run test

To run tests enable the virtual environment

Then run:

```
FLASK_ENV=testing pipenv run pytest .
```

or

```
FLASK_ENV=testing pipenv run pytest controller services models tests
```

which is faster

### Pre-commit

```
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

enjoy
